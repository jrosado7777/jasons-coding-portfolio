      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a self-taught Full Stack Software Engineer with nearly three years of professional experience delivering both frontend and backend solutions. My strengths are in JavaScript, React, REST APIs, and modern UI design, complemented by solid backend expertise in Java, Spring, AWS, and microservices architecture.</p>
      <p>I’ve built multiple full stack applications, some of which you can explore here on my portfolio, and have hands-on experience with containerization using Docker, DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and database management with PostgreSQL and DynamoDB. I thrive on learning new technologies quickly and collaborating with teams to deliver impactful results.</p>
      <p>Beyond software development, I bring years of experience in training, running scrum meetings, and managing projects. From leading coding teams, to my work in banking, to my own video production business, I value collaboration and creating products people love to use. My long-term goal is to keep growing as a developer and leader, creating environments where teams can do their best work.</p>
      <p>I’m eager to contribute my technical skills and over a decade of diverse experience to help your team succeed.</p>
