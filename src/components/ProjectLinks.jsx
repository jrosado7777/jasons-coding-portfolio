      <h2>My Projects</h2>

      <p>
        As the sole developer for a global nonprofit, I built a full-stack web application using AWS AppSync, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, and Amplify. The app included dynamic conversation flows, secure user logins, and BI dashboards across international availability zones. I also deployed infrastructure with CodePipeline, CloudFront, and WAF to protect internal data.

      <p>
        During my time as a DoD contractor, I worked on a mission-critical microservices-based system. I maintained frontend React components, optimized performance with Redis caching, built REST endpoints in Java with Spring Boot, and managed Postgres and RabbitMQ within Docker environments. I also trained new employees, led test coverage with RTL/Cypress, and contributed to permission systems, data grids, and cloud deployments.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the founder of Production Studio of Colorado LLC, I designed and maintained websites for real estate clients â€” capturing media, updating content, and ensuring quick delivery under client deadlines.
